\section{Goals}

\label{sec:goals}

The overall goal of the project is to implement a decentralised prediction
market in which users may act as arbiters in markets in which they themselves
are stakeholders. This will be achieved by the following essential objectives:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep0em
	\item create a web application where users may specify bets to trade on
	\item implement a trading mechanism allowing users to buy and sell
		shares in user-made securities
	\item crowdsource outcome determination using reports from arbiters who may
		hold positions in the markets
	\item incentivise truthful reporting from the arbiters
\end{itemize}

These goals will largely be achieved by implementing the mechanism laid out by
Freeman et al~\cite{CODiPM}. The first three goals cover core functionality of
any decentralised prediction market, while the fourth is concerned with tuning
system parameters, before and during execution, in order to ensure that users
do not manipulate the mechanism.
 
Other features that we look to implement that are not essential to the running
of the system but highly desirable for user experience include asynchronous
communication with the server to display up-to-date pricing information without
a page refresh, and the automated closing of markets.  Indeed, while their
current omission does not necessarily hamper the functionality of the market
itself, they should be implemented in order for the system to run smoothly and
independently.

The following additional features could be implemented, although they are not
the focus of the project or are unlikely to be achieved in the remaining time
frame. They include removing the need to explicitly ask for signal beliefs
from arbiters; the option to sort markets by categories; displaying user trade
histories; and sanitising database inputs.
