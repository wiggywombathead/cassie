		information about a future event. To function, the market needs a
			trusted entity who will verify the true outcome in the end.
			Motivated by the recent introduction of decentralized prediction
			markets, we introduce a mechanism that allows for the outcome to be
			determined by the votes of a group of arbiters who may themselves
			hold stakes in the market. Despite the potential conflict of
			interest, we derive conditions under which we can incentivize
			arbiters to vote truthfully by using funds raised from market fees
			to implement a peer prediction mechanism. Finally, we investigate
			what parameter values could be used in a real-world implementation
			of our mechanism.},
