	A prediction market is a means of aggregating information about random
	variables and using the beliefs of its participants to calculate a
	prediction on the variable's outcome. Decentralised prediction markets
	differ from traditional ones in that they allow any user to specify the
	bets on which they would like to trade. In this project we implement a
	decentralised prediction market that uses participation from the community
	to both specify the available markets and then decide on their outcome by
	submission of reports from a group of arbiters. The mechanism we implement
	is incentive compatible, meaning it is always in a user's best interests to
	act truthfully: this is achieved by rewarding arbiters for truthful
	reporting and ensuring this payoff is never less than what they would gain
	by misreporting.
