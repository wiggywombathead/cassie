# Hermes
## Description
A platform on which to host various types of auctions. Upon entering your bids,
the platform analyses the submitted bids to decide on which auction to revenue,
based on which metric you wish to maximise.

Also provides a platform on which to simulate and benchmark the different types
of auctions, allowing you to play around with the various parameters that
characterise each auction (number of bidders, valuation functions, trade
setting, etc.)

## Why the name?
Hermes was the Greek god of (among other things) trade. I am currently debating
whether to call it instead Mercury, the Roman counterpart.
