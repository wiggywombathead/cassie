\section{Project Management}

\label{sec:projectManagement}

\subsection{Methodology}

The project has been developed incrementally, with a focus on integrating new
functionality completely before progressing to new features. This approach is
well-suited to this project's design: since it comprises of five separate areas
which are drawn together at the end, it is possible to focus on implementing a
feature within one area without it affecting the rest. As a result, testing has
been performed throughout and ensures that a newer version of the project is
never worse than its predecessor. Using Git and Github has been helpful in this
regard, providing cloud storage and the ability to roll back to previous
versions of the project if the current one is broken by a new feature.

Meetings have been taken with this project's supervisor, Professor Matthias
Englert to track progress. These were more regular towards the beginning of the
project, though as it began to take more shape the consistency of these
meetings declined. As we will discuss in the following section, this is due in
part to the exam period, during which most focus was diverted towards revision,
however the original frequency was never picked up after this time as was
initially planned. Moreover, it bears mentioning that the current situation
within which we find ourselves regarding the coronavirus pandemic may also have
affected the frequency of these meetings. Regardless, the author feels more
initiative should have been taken on his end to ensure their consistency. We
shall next describe our approach towards the scheduling of this project.

\subsection{Scheduling}

There have been few major issues with regards to the scheduling of this
project, although it undergone a slight change from the timetable in its
original conception. Figure~\ref{fig:old-timetable} shows the schedule as it
was planned at the time of our presentation on the project, which was when it
was still in its early stages of development. In Figure~\ref{fig:new-timetable}
we detail the order in which tasks were actually carried out.

An initial prototype of the prediction market had been written in time for the
presentation and at its core our current iteration is very similar to this
early version with respect to the datatypes we define and the processes of
trading and arbitration. However, it was entirely text-based and had no
capacity for persistent storage, meaning it was unusable in a practical
setting. At any rate its purpose was to showcase the mechanism in action and
this is, at its core, very simple. 

Work after this point was focused on translating this terminal-based
implementation to operate on a barebones web server, with the first steps to
achieve persistent storage via interaction with a database. Since Mito's
\code{deftable} macro is functionally very similar to that of Common Lisp's
\code{defstruct}, after reading documentation on setting the system up
correctly and connecting to it, this conversion was relatively straightforward.
Similarly, the code to set up and begin defining webpages in our implementation
is simple and hence took little time to set up. In the case of both the web
server and the database, a significantly larger portion of time was spent
deciding how to integrate features as they were developed into the system as a
whole: there is the implicit assumption that each feature added incorporated
not only the logic to get it working but also designing new webpages and adding
to the database interface. Some issues were encountered trying to implement
asynchronous communication with the server via Parenscript and Smackjack, and
much time was spent getting this working. This highlights one of the drawbacks
behind using both libraries: while they are well-documented in that their
reference manuals detail each function they provide, it seems they are not
widely used and hence have few practical examples online from which to learn.

Worthy of note is the two-week delay from the original deadline for the interim
report, arising from the university-wide implementation of a two-week extension
to all assessed work. We took the decision to take advantage of this decision
by spending an extra two weeks to implement the arbitration stage to a greater
degree of completion. This did not affect the overall

\textbf{TODO}

%Firstly, although an early demonstration of the market and arbitration stages
%was complete for the presentation, this did not yet use any persistent storage
%or actual users. Therefore, to get these stages working as they would in the
%final project, the website and database interface first needed implementing.
%This has taken the majority of the time since the presentation, and includes
%defining the various pages and forms with which the users interact with the
%markets, as well as how we interact with the database to register, log in, and
%pay users. As we will cover in the next section, there are only three main
%areas of functionality left to target: asynchronous communication with the
%server via AJAX calls, automation of the system regarding closing markets once
%enough arbiters have submitted reports, and most importantly parameter tuning.
%The latter has been given a large block of time to complete since there are
%many values on which certain parameters depend, and it is imagined that
%calculating these accurately will require care.

%Secondly, the time dedicated to writing the interim report has been extended by
%two weeks to reflect the extension to its deadline. Although it was not
%initially required, the extra time that could be diverted towards developing
%the systems while the writing of the report was delayed was useful in providing
%more material to discuss. This was also caused in part by more focus than
%anticipated being paid towards exam preparation.

%\subsection{Next Steps}

%% Parameter tuning which requires processing of all data submitted 
%% Asynchronous database queries to keep page details accurate

%The next task is to tune the parameters of the system to ensure truthful
%reporting, since this is the entire reason for implementing the mechanism. This
%includes setting transaction fee $f$ to the appropriate percentage and the
%payment parameter $k$. It will also be important to fully automate the system,
%meaning the server automatically decides when to close markets: this is
%currently done by prompting the system to compute market outcomes, which is
%insufficient. The final important feature to add is asynchronous server
%communication -- although it does not necessarily add new functionality to the
%core of the prediction market, it would dramatically increase usability. 

%We plan to dedicate a significant portion of August to the writing of the
%dissertation, to spread the workload more evenly and to allow features that are
%developed later more time to be added into the report.  We hope to get feedback
%on a draft of the dissertation three weeks before the final deadline so that
%the following weeks can be spent refining the material, and for more versions
%to be produced in the remaining time. This means we intend to get all required
%goals working well before the end of the month, to ensure we are not making
%considerable changes shortly before the deadline.

\subsection{Ethics}

There is little ethical consideration required for the development of this
project. All development and testing has been done independently, and all
resources used to implement the system are available freely. Testing has been
performed externally only to small extent, and even then only informally
through gathering opinions amongst colleagues. As we have discussed has been a
problem for existing prediction markets, there is one ethical issue that arises
from using real money in prediction markets and this is their potential to
inspire ``assassination markets'', where there is a real-life incentive to
change the outcome of the market through committing actions of dubious
character, such as assassinating the subject of a security speculating on the
time of their death. We avoid testing the strength of our users' moral fibre by
using fake money only, with no real-world value, meaning there is no incentive
to act in such a way as to compromise one's integrity.
