\section{Project Management}

\label{sec:projectManagement}

\subsection{Methodology}

The project has been developed incrementally, with a focus on integrating new
functionality completely before progressing to new features. This approach is
well-suited to this project's design: since it comprises of five separate areas
which are drawn together at the end, it is possible to focus on implementing a
feature within one area without it affecting the rest. As a result, testing has
been performed throughout and ensures that a newer version of the project is
never worse than its predecessor. Using Git and Github has been helpful in this
regard, providing cloud storage and the ability to roll back to previous
versions of the project if the current one is broken by a new feature.

Meetings have been taken with this project's supervisor, Professor Matthias
Englert to track progress. These were more regular towards the beginning of the
project, though as it began to take more shape the consistency of these
meetings declined. As we will discuss in the following section, this is due in
part to the exam period, during which most focus was diverted towards revision,
however the original frequency was never picked up after this time as was
initially planned. Moreover, it bears mentioning that the current situation
within which we find ourselves regarding the coronavirus pandemic may also have
affected the frequency of these meetings. Regardless, the author feels more
initiative should have been taken on his end to ensure their consistency. We
shall next describe our approach towards the scheduling of this project.

\subsection{Scheduling}

There have been few major issues with regards to the scheduling of this
project, although it undergone a slight change from the timetable in its
original conception. Figure~\ref{fig:old-timetable} shows the schedule as it
was planned at the time of our presentation on the project, which was when it
was still in its early stages of development. In Figure~\ref{fig:new-timetable}
we detail the order in which tasks were actually carried out.

An initial prototype of the prediction market had been written in time for the
presentation and at its core our current iteration is very similar to this
early version with respect to the datatypes we define and the processes of
trading and arbitration. However, it was entirely text-based and had no
capacity for persistent storage, meaning it was unusable in a practical
setting. At any rate its purpose was to showcase the mechanism in action and
this is, at its core, very simple. 

Work after this point was focused on translating this terminal-based
implementation to operate on a barebones web server, with the first steps to
achieve persistent storage via interaction with a database. Since Mito's
\code{deftable} macro is functionally very similar to that of Common Lisp's
\code{defstruct}, this conversion was relatively straightforward. Similarly,
the code to set up and begin defining webpages in our implementation is simple
and hence took little time. In the case of both the web server and the
database, a significantly larger portion of time was spent deciding how to
integrate features as they were developed into the system as a whole: there is
the implicit assumption that each feature added incorporated not only the logic
to get it working but also designing new webpages and adding to the database
interface. Some issues were encountered trying to implement asynchronous
communication with the server via Parenscript and Smackjack, and much time was
spent getting this working. This highlights one of the drawbacks behind using
both libraries: while they are well-documented in that their reference manuals
detail each function they provide, it seems they are not widely used and hence
have few practical examples online from which to learn.

Worthy of note is the two-week delay from the original deadline for the interim
report, arising from the university-wide implementation of a two-week extension
to all assessed work. We took the decision to take advantage of this decision
by spending an extra two weeks to implement the arbitration stage to a greater
degree of completion, in order to have more material for discussion in the
interim report. This did not affect the overall progress of the project,
however, since the two weeks worth of progress made during this time was simply
borrowed from what would have been achieved in the two weeks after the original
deadline.

\textbf{TODO}

\subsection{Ethics}

There is little ethical consideration required for the development of this
project. All development and testing has been done independently, and all
resources used to implement the system are available freely. Testing has been
performed externally only to small extent, and even then only informally
through gathering opinions amongst colleagues. As we have discussed has been a
problem for existing prediction markets, there is one ethical issue that arises
from using real money in prediction markets and this is their potential to
inspire ``assassination markets'', where there is a real-life incentive to
change the outcome of the market through committing actions of dubious
character, such as assassinating the subject of a security speculating on the
time of their death. We avoid testing the strength of our users' moral fibre by
using fake money only, with no real-world value, meaning there is no incentive
to act in such a way as to compromise one's integrity.
