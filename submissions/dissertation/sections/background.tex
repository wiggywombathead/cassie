\section{Background}

\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Setup}

Consider the following problem within algorithmic mechanism design known as the
\emph{information aggregation problem}~\cite[Ch.~26]{AGTBook}. An individual
known as the ``aggregator'' wishes to obtain a prediction about an uncertain
variable which will be realised at some point in the future. There are a number
of individuals known as the ``informants'' who each hold sets of information
about the variable's outcome. The goal is to design a mechanism that extracts
the relevant information from the informants and uses it to provide a
prediction of the variable's realisation. In an ideal setting the mechanism
should produce the same prediction as an omniscient forecast that has access to
all information available to all informants. This may not be viable in
practice, since each agent's information is private information, and so the
mechanism must incentivise them to act in the desired truth-telling manner.

A prediction market is one mechanism that can provide such a forecast. In this
setting the aggregator creates a financial security whose payoff is tied to the
outcome of the variable. In the simpler case of binary events, such a security
may pay out \$1 for each share held if the variable has a ``true'' or ``yes''
outcome, and \$0 otherwise, however markets can be created for other types
including discrete (``will the result of the match be a home win, away win, or
a draw?''), continuous (``what will be the highest measured temperature in
Coventry in September?''), or any combination of these types. Informants are
then able to participate in the market induced by the security by trading
shares according to their beliefs: those who believe, for example, that global
warming is real might buy shares at a given price in the market, ``the global
average temperature in 2020 will be higher than that in 2019'', while deniers
may be inclined to sell shares. The share price will be adjusted accordingly,
and the aggregator can view the current price as the informant's combined
belief of the outcome of the event.

In this model there is a set $\Omega$ of possible states of the world and at
any moment the world is in exactly one state $\omega \in \Omega$, though the
informants do not know which. Each informant $i$ may however possess partial
information regarding this true state, and this is represented by a partition
$\pi_i$ of $\Omega$. The agent knows in which subset of this partition the true
world state lies, but does not know the exact member of which is true. Given
$n$ agents, their combined information $\hat{\pi}$ is the coarsest common
refinement of the partitions $\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_n$.\footnote{A partition
$\alpha$ of a set $X$ is a refinement of a partition $\rho$ of $X$ if every
element of $\alpha$ is a subset of some element of $\rho$. In this case
$\alpha$ is \emph{finer} than $\rho$ and $\rho$ is \emph{coarser} than
$\alpha$.}

We also assume a common prior probability distribution $P \in \Delta^{\Omega}$
which describes the probabilities that all agents assign to the different world
states before receiving any information. Once each agent receives their partial
information, they form their posterior beliefs by restricting the common prior
to the subset of their partition in which they know the true state to lie. For
our purposes, a \emph{forecast} is an estimate of the expected value of the
function $f : \Omega \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, known as an \emph{event}, which
equals one for exactly one subset of $\Omega$ and 0 otherwise.

As mentioned, there is an ideal ``omniscient'' forecast that uses the
distribution $P$ restricted to the subset of $\hat{\pi}$ in which the true
world state lies but which is impractical given the private nature of each
agent's information. The goal is therefore a mechanism to incentivise agents to
reveal their private information such that in equilibrium we achieve a forecast
as close as possible to the omniscient one. Prediction markets offer the agents
the chance of financial gain for revealing information regarding the expected
value of $f(\omega)$, and the share price of the security can be interpreted as
the collective forecast of the agents. In Section~\ref{sec:design} we shall
outline the different approaches one can take to designing the prediction
market mechanism itself and the one among them, a Market Scoring Rule, that we
implement. Importantly, Market Scoring Rules are one of the ways to increase
liquidity in the market as the system itself assumes the opposite side to any
trade, meaning users may participate even when no other user wishes to buy or
sell for what they are asking or bidding. This means a trade is always able to
be executed, although without care the system could make consistent losses.

The Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) are real-money prediction markets developed
by the University of Iowa~\cite{IEM} that have been running since 1988. They
allow users to buy and sell contracts based on the outcome of U.S. political
elections and economic indicators, and are currently offering markets for the
winning party of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the vote share between
the Democratic and Republican parties in the 2020 U.S. presidential election,
and the compositions of the houses of Congress, House of Representatives, and
U.S. Senate after the outcome of the 2020 U.S. congressional elections. The
number of markets offered is small and the topics are kept relevant to current
events, meaning there is likely to be high liquidity for any security a user
wishes to trade in. This has allowed the markets to predict the results of
political elections with more accuracy and less error than traditional polls:
for the presidential elections between 1988 and 2000, three-quarters of the
time the IEM's market price on the day each poll was released was more accurate
for predicting vote share than the poll itself~\cite[pg.~19]{WisdomOfCrowds}.
These markets inspired similar markets in the forms of the Hollywood Stock
Exchange, NewsFutures, and the Foresight Exchange report, which achieved
similar successes despite not using real money. 

An issue with these markets is that they are restrictive in the bets they
offer. Although this can be beneficial in that they provide a focused and
liquid market in which to trade, it leaves them potentially less interesting to
interact with. A combinatorial prediction market is a solution to this and
drastically increases the number of events that can be bet on and outcomes
predicted by offering securities on interrelated propositions that can be
combined in various ways. One example of such a market is that of
\emph{Predictalot}~\cite{Predictalot}, a combinatorial prediction market
developed by Yahoo! that allowed users to trade securities in the 2010 NCAA
Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The tournament sees the top 64 teams
play 63 games in a knockout competition, yielding a total outcome space of size
$2^{63}$. \emph{Predictalot} then kept track of the odds, computing them by
scanning through all of the predictions made by users. This prediction market
was the original inspiration for this project in investigating prediction
markets. Using a Market Scoring Rule for such a market would involve computing
a summation over the entire outcome space $\Omega$, an intractable, \#P-hard
problem akin to counting the number of variable assignments that satisfy a CNF
formula, or or the number of subsets in a list of integers that sum to zero.
Instead, they employ an implementation of importance sampling, a technique for
estimating properties of a particular probability distribution using only
samples generated from a different distribution. This ``naive'' approach is
then improved upon by the work of Dud\`ik, Lahaie, and
Pennock~\cite{Dudik2012}, who use convex optimisation and constraint generation
to develop a market maker which is tractable. This approach lies somewhere
between treating all securities as independent and a fully combinatorial,
``ideal'' market maker, propagating information among related securities for
more complete information aggregation. The ways in which their odds are
calculated are also natural: for example, a large bet on a team to win the
entire tournament automatically increases the odds that the same team will
progress past the first round, since they would not be able to win the
competition without doing so. This work is then improved upon by Kroer,
Dud\`ik, Lahaie, and Balakrishnan~\cite{Kroer2016}, in which they use integer
programming to achieve arbitrage-free trades, or always profitable risk-free
trades. On top of achieving bounded loss, a crucial element behind a market
mechanism operating in the real world and avoiding bankruptcy, avoiding
arbitrage is desirable as it leads to more accurate forecasts: since users
cannot make risk-free profits, they are forced to bet according to their true
beliefs.

All examples so far have involved a centralised market mechanism. These types
of systems involve a central authority providing the bets upon which users may
bet and then verifying their outcome. \emph{Decentralised} markets allow the
users themselves to define their own bets and trade shares in them. These types
of systems involve a central authority providing the bets upon which users may
bet and then verifying their outcome. These types of markets allow the users
themselves to define their own markets by providing custom bets and them
trading shares in them. Several examples of decentralised markets exist and
they are often implemented with cryptocurrencies. Peterson et
al.~\cite{Peterson2015} study the setting and use it to implement the oracle at
the heart of \emph{Augur}~\cite{Augur}, a decentralised prediction market built
upon the Ethereum blockchain that launched in 2018. It allows users to offer
predictions on any topic, and markets may be either categorical, which are
similar to binary markets in which the winner takes all, or scalar, which offer
users a spectrum of outcomes in which to invest. For example, users may bet
that the global average temperature for 2020 will lie in a certain range.  As
in many decentralised markets, outcomes of events are then resolved by the
users, and in the case of \emph{Augur} users are incentivised to report
truthfully by way of paying reporting fees. This amounts to users depositing
tokens to back their report, and token holders are then entitled to the trading
fees generated.

As can often be the case with real-money markets, however, the platform had
quickly devolved into an assassination market~\cite{AugurDeathMarket} --
originally this referred to the case where users created markets on the deaths
of certain people, which then incentivised their assassination. A user could
stand to profit by placing a bet on the exact time of their death, and ensure
this bet was profitable by assassinating the subject. More generally this
refers to the users of a prediction market having the ability to influence a
market's outcome and acting on this opportunity. Another issue with
\emph{Augur} is the option to report a market's outcome as ``invalid'': this is
for the case where the user-made bet is too ambiguous to decided, such as,
``Bayern Munich will play well against Paris Saint Germain''.

Other decentralised markets based on cryptocurrencies exist, including
\emph{Omen}~\cite{Omen} and \emph{Hivemind}~\cite{Hivemind}. The former is
similar to \emph{Augur} in that it allows users to create markets for any bet
they like and whose outcomes are not decided by the system itself. Whereas
\emph{Augur} uses a reputation system in the form of requiring users to back
their report of a market's outcome with \$REP tokens, \emph{Omen} asks the
market creator to supply an ``oracle'' through which the outcome can be
determined. They note that this oracle can even be \emph{Augur}. Although this
may solve the ``invalid'' outcome option for ambiguous bets, it may introduce
bias into the process of outcome determination. For example, suppose a user
creates a market for ``The Democratic nominee will tell a lie during tonight's
debate'' and lists the oracle as the conservative news channel, Fox News. Users
would then trade on how they think the oracle will report the outcome, and not
what they believe the outcome will be themselves. An important aspect of
decentralised markets must therefore be that the outcome is determined by the
community, not a single source. 

In contrast to \emph{Augur}, which implements a traditional orderbook using
Ethereum, \emph{Omen} uses an automated market maker to provide liquidity to
its securities. Two approaches to this include using a Market Scoring Rule to
update the odds on a given event, and implementing a parimutuel market where
users compete for a share of the total money wagered while the share price
varies dynamically according to some cost function. Hanson~\cite{Hanson2003}
shows that we can use any strictly proper scoring rule to implement an
automated market maker: with such scoring rules, agents maximise their expected
utility by truthfully revealing their predictions. In particular, in this
project we implement the peer prediction market introduced by Freeman, Lahaie,
and Pennock~\cite{CODiPM}, which specifies a market that uses a Market Scoring
Rule to trade bets and crowdsources outcome determination, similarly to
\emph{Augur}, by asking users for reports. All they require is that the rule is
strictly proper, giving plenty of choice to study the effects different rules
have on user behaviour. While the choice of scoring rule is less important than
the mechanism by which market outcomes are determined, a recent work by Liu,
Wang, and Chen~\cite{Liu2020} introduces scoring rules for the setting where
the aggregator has access only to user reports, which they call Surrogate
Scoring Rules (SSRs). This appears to be an interesting avenue to further
explore and adapt to a prediction market. One assumption they make, however,
seems incompatible with the decentralised setting in that they require all
events to be independent.  Given that users can create a market for \emph{any}
bet, this condition is impossible to ensure. Since SSRs can be strictly proper
under certain conditions, they may be applicable as the Market Scoring Rule in
\cite{CODiPM}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Both \emph{PredictIt} \cite{PredictIt} and the Iowa Electronic Markets
%(IEM) \cite{IEM} provide the ability to make bets on various political
%events, including on outcomes within the 2020 US presidential election.
%However, like \emph{Augur}, they do not provide the ability to combine
%these bets in complex ways and hence this is a gap that this project aims
%to fill.
%
%Prediction markets receive considerable attention within the algorithmic game
%theory literature. They have been used to predict the outcomes of a range of
%events, particularly in business, sports, and politics~\cite{Spann2003,
%Berg2006}. Nay, Van der Linden, and Gilligan~\cite{Nay2016} analyse prediction
%markets empirically to study how market parameters may affect an agent's
%beliefs on the real-world outcome, making the argument for a prediction market
%for betting on the cause of global warming to show how increased agent
%participation can cause public belief to shift towards the ``correct'' cause.
%They are therefore powerful not only in aggregating public opinion, but also in
%their ability to change it.
%
%In the centralised setting Kroer, Dud\'ik, Lahaie, and
%Balakrishnan~\cite{Kroer2016} introduce a cost-based market maker in which all
%bets are bought and sold to the market, rather than the traders, which
%sidesteps the problem of low liquidity in traditional markets. Another way to
%avoid low liquidity is to use a market scoring rule: Liu, Wang, and
%Chen~\cite{Liu2020} introduce Surrogate Scoring Rules to elicit private
%probabilistic beliefs with access only to agents' reports, which is similar to
%our setting. Their mechanisms do not rely on a ground truth to quantify the
%quality of the elicited information, and could hence be particularly applicable
%to decentralised prediction markets. Freeman et al.~\cite{CODiPM} take such a
%decentralised approach and introduce a mechanism in which market outcomes are
%crowdsourced by a group of arbiters. They derive the conditions under which
%arbiters are incentivised to act truthfully, even if an arbiter reports on a
%market where they themselves hold a stake, and theirs is the paper upon which
%we base our design. Several other decentralised markets exist: Peterson et
%al.~\cite{Peterson2015} study the setting to implement the decentralised oracle
%behind the prediction market \emph{Augur}~\cite{Augur}, which uses a reputation
%system to protect against manipulation. Similar markets based on
%cryptocurrencies exist in \emph{Gnosis}~\cite{Gnosis} and
%\emph{Hivemind}~\cite{Hivemind}, though it has not been shown that any of these
%achieve any theoretical guarantees of truthfulness.
